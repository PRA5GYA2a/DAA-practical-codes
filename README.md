## 📘 Project Overview

### 📝 Summary

In this project, we developed a machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. We used Python and libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to build a [classification/regression/clustering] model. The dataset used was [Dataset Name], which contains [brief description of data]. 

Our goals were to:
- Understand and explore the dataset
- Apply appropriate preprocessing techniques
- Train multiple ML models and compare performance
- Evaluate the final model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Optionally deploy the model using Streamlit for interactive predictions

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of an AI solution, from raw data to insights and deployment.

This project focuses on **building and evaluating an AI model to solve a real-world problem using machine learning techniques**.
